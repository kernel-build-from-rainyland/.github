# Notes!!!!!!!!!

Currently I'm so busy so I may won't do custom build tho. All requests may stalled

# Kernel Build From RainyLand
We provide some open build for some aosp gki / non-gki devices.

# Current support
We currently support this build type
- aosp-gki
- aosp-non-gki

So if you're trying to using in MIUI or some strictly OS, it may failed to boot. We will try to support it in the future
